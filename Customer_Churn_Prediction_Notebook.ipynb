    "**Understanding Customer Attrition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer attrition, also known as churn or turnover, refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company's product or service within a certain period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if a company begins the year with 500 customers but ends with only 480, the churn rate is 4%. Predicting why and when customers leave can significantly help organizations strategize retention efforts.\n",

    "**Project Goal**\n",

    "This project aims to:\n",
    "- Determine the likelihood of customer churn\n",
    "- Identify key indicators of churn\n",
    "- Propose effective retention strategies to mitigate customer attrition.\n"

    "\n",
    "Telecommunication companies (telcos) like Vodafone Corporation encounter a common issue known as customer churn, where customers discontinue their services. Addressing this challenge requires telcos to anticipate which customers are likely to churn and implement proactive strategies to retain them. Machine learning models offer a solution by predicting potential churners based on factors such as usage patterns, payment history, and demographic data.\n"
